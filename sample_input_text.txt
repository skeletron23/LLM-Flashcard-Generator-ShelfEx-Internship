The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, heated to incandescence by nuclear fusion reactions in its core. The Sun's energy is emitted as sunlight and provides the energy for most life on Earth via photosynthesis. The Sun has been an object of reverence in many cultures throughout human history.

Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass more than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. It is named after the Roman god Jupiter.
